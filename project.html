   <hr>
   <p style="font-size:20px;">
   The curriculum is built to provide a comprehensive understanding of the four pillars of Business Administration: Finance, Marketing, Entrepreneurship, and Business Analytics. Each of these pillars is offered to students to opt from as their major. However, in the spirit of providing freedom to the students, we do not limit a student to courses that they wish to major in. Additionally, we expose students to academic writings, digital literacy, and debates, which do not fall in the scheme of things in most of the schools across the nation.
